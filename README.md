# Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)

Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) is a cancer that arises from the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. It is the most common type of uterine cancer and predominantly affects women after menopause. This document provides an in-depth overview of UCEC, including its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.

## Anatomy and Physiology

The uterus is a pear-shaped organ located in the pelvis, consisting of three primary layers:
- **Endometrium:** The innermost layer, which thickens and sheds during the menstrual cycle.
- **Myometrium:** A thick muscular layer forming the bulk of the uterus.
- **Perimetrium:** The outermost serosal layer.

UCEC originates in the endometrium and is classified into two major histological subtypes:
1. **Type I (Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma):** Hormone-sensitive and often associated with estrogen exposure. It typically has a favorable prognosis.
2. **Type II (Non-Endometrioid Carcinomas):** Includes serous, clear cell, and other rare subtypes. These are aggressive and associated with poorer outcomes.

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence:** UCEC is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with higher prevalence in developed countries.
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Prolonged estrogen exposure (e.g., due to obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, or hormone replacement therapy).
  - Genetic predispositions such as Lynch syndrome.
  - Advanced age (postmenopausal women are at highest risk).
  - Lifestyle factors like obesity and physical inactivity.

## Pathophysiology

UCEC development involves genetic and molecular alterations, including:
- **PTEN, KRAS, and PIK3CA mutations:** Frequently seen in Type I cancers.
- **p53 mutations and HER2 overexpression:** Common in aggressive Type II cancers.
- **Microsatellite Instability (MSI):** Frequently associated with Lynch syndrome and indicates defective DNA mismatch repair mechanisms.

Prolonged estrogen exposure without the balancing effect of progesterone can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, progressing to atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Early Symptoms:**
  - Abnormal uterine bleeding (e.g., postmenopausal bleeding or irregular bleeding in premenopausal women).
  - Watery or blood-tinged vaginal discharge.
  - Pelvic pain or pressure (less common).

- **Advanced Symptoms:**
  - Severe pelvic pain.
  - Unintentional weight loss.
  - Symptoms of metastasis (e.g., lung or liver involvement).

## Diagnosis

### Initial Evaluation
- Medical history and physical examination.
- Pelvic ultrasound to measure endometrial thickness.
- Endometrial biopsy for histological confirmation.

### Imaging Studies
- MRI or CT scans to evaluate local invasion and distant metastasis.
- PET scans for advanced staging.

### Molecular Profiling
- MSI testing or mismatch repair (MMR) protein analysis.
- Genetic testing for hereditary syndromes such as Lynch syndrome.

## Staging

UCEC is staged using the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system:
- **Stage I:** Confined to the uterus.
- **Stage II:** Involves the cervix but not beyond the uterus.
- **Stage III:** Extends to pelvic structures or lymph nodes.
- **Stage IV:** Distant metastasis (e.g., bladder, bowel, or other organs).

## Treatment

### 1. Surgery
- Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the cornerstone treatment for early-stage UCEC.
- Lymph node assessment is performed for staging and prognosis.

### 2. Radiation Therapy
- External beam radiation or brachytherapy is used for local control in intermediate and high-risk cases.

### 3. Chemotherapy
- Often used for advanced or high-grade cancers.
- Common regimens include carboplatin and paclitaxel.

### 4. Hormonal Therapy
- Progestins, tamoxifen, or aromatase inhibitors for hormone-sensitive tumors.

### 5. Targeted Therapy and Immunotherapy
- **VEGF inhibitors:** Target angiogenesis.
- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors:** Pembrolizumab is effective in MSI-high or MMR-deficient tumors.

---

## Prognosis

- **Type I cancers:** Generally have a good prognosis, especially when diagnosed early.
- **Type II cancers:** Tend to be more aggressive, with higher recurrence rates and poorer outcomes.

Prognosis is influenced by the cancer stage, histological subtype, and molecular features at the time of diagnosis.

## Prevention and Screening

### Preventive Measures
- Maintain a healthy weight through diet and exercise.
- Manage hormonal imbalances effectively.
- Combined oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of UCEC.

### Screening
- Routine screening is not recommended for the general population.
- High-risk individuals, such as those with Lynch syndrome, benefit from regular monitoring.

## Conclusion

Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma is a heterogeneous disease with varying clinical and molecular profiles. Early detection and advances in targeted therapies continue to improve outcomes. Public awareness and management of modifiable risk factors are essential for reducing the disease burden.
